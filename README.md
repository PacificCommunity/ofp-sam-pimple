# PIMPLE

**P**erformance **I**ndicators for **M**anagement **P**rocedures exp**L**or**E**r

An R-Shiny tool for exploring the MSE results for WCPFC harvest strategies.

## Note

The code for older versions of PIMPLE (up to 10/10/2022) are in the old [ofp-sam-amped](https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-amped) repository.

The old repository has all the AMPLE apps and PIMPLE. These projects are no longer linked.
It became awkward to individually maintain these distinct projects and their releases with a single repo.

Hence, this repo, started on the 10/10/2022, has just PIMPLE. It takes the PIMPLE code from the *PIMPLE_SMD_2022* branch of the old repo.
