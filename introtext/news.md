## December 2022

* Added adopted HCR (MP) adopted by WCPFC19.
* Only Adopted HCR is selected at the start.

## November 2022

* Added robustness sets including hyperstability; low recruitment; and effort creep scenarios.
* Changed the SB/SBF=0 relative to SB/SBF=0 in 2012 indicator to SB/SBF=0 relative to target (where the target is determined as equilibrium stock status under baseline fishing levels).
* Added effort relative to effort in reference period indicator for effort driven fisheries (purse seine and pole & line).
* Box plots are now the default presentation method instead of bar charts.
* Moved pole and line CPUE to 'Compare performance' tab.

## October 2022

* Release of PIMPLE for MOC in preparation for WCPFC 19 (https://ofp-sam.shinyapps.io/PIMPLE_WCPFC19/)
* Following guidance from the WCPFC first Science-Management Dialogue meeting, the HCR selection has been reduced to HCR 1, 2, 5, 6 and 9, all with a +-10% constraint on how much the output of the HCR can change between management periods.
* Pole and line fisheries now managed through setting of effort limits (relative to the effort 2001-2004) instead of catch.
* Added pole and line CPUE, relative to 2001-2004 under the 'Other SKJ indicators' tab.
* Added HCR parameters to the 'SKJ management procedures' tab.
