## What is PIMPLE?

PIMPLE is a tool for exploring and comparing the performance of alternative candidate management procedures (MPs) for WCPO skipjack.

A management procedure has three components:

1. Data collection
2. Estimation method (stock assessment model)
3. Harvest Control Rule (HCR)

For the current set of results, the data collection and estimation method are the same for each MP, and only the HCRs are different.
This means that we can directly compare the performance of the HCRs.

The aim is to select the HCR that is most likely to meet your management objectives.

The performance of each HCR is measured using different performance indicators (PIs).
PIMPLE can be used to explore and compare the PIs in a number of ways, using different plots and tables.
This allows trade-offs between the different HCRs to be evaluated.

Additional metrics, such as Kobe and Majuro plots, are also available.

The focus should be on the *relative* performance of the different HCRs, e.g. HCR X performs better than HCR Y.

## How to use PIMPLE

The main purpose of PIMPLE is to compare the relative performance of the candidate HCRs. This is most easily done using the **Compare performance** tab at the top of the screen.
This tab allows you to view the indicators using different plot types (see below).

To aid investigation it is possible to select the indicators that are of most interest, and deselect those that are of less interest.
Similarly, it is possible to select and deselect HCRs to focus attention on a smaller subset.

Other performance indicators can be found under the **Other indicators** tab at the top.
This allows you to see some of the PI in more detail, for example viewing the catch based indicators by model area.
