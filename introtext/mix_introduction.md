# Mixed fishery indicators

Under construction!

This section explores the combined impacts of the skipjack and bigeye management procedures (MPs) on the bigeye and yellowfin stocks.
The skipjack, bigeye and yellow evaluations are run together in a multi-species modelling framework described in the WCPFC Scientific Committee paper WCPFC-SC17-2021/MI-WP-05. 

The SB/SBF=0 and probability of being below the LRP are presented.

There are currently no bigeye MPs.
Instead three different assumptions are made about the level of the fishing in the tropical longline fishery:

* Status quo (average catches of 2016-2018)
* 15% below status quo
* 15% above status quo
